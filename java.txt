general:

1. use try catch with resources with database connections
2. use prepared statements if you're filtering by different attributes dynamically
3. Keep in mind the execution times of Java Collections e.g don't use an arraylist for keeping track of copies, use a set

jpa:

1. use saveAll, deleteAll operations - jpa
2. use specifications API instead of hardcoding filters in psql statements
3. use entity manager with native queries in case of complicated logic
